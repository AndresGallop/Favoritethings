# Favourite Things

This is a project that shows my three favorite things in the world;
It is going to use dynamic data fetched from a .sql database and rendered in html.

## Tools used

For this project I am going to use a Database(.sql file), HTML, CSS(Sass method), JS(Modules type) and JSON file with the AJAX method. 

## Usage

The code here will allow me to render dynamic data in a web site. This code will be used to make my portfolio as well.

## Road map

1. Create the database with 4 columns and 3 rows; parameters : id, Thing, Recommendation, Quote and Img.
2. Create the layout in html and then stylize it with CSS using Sass modules to make it more organized.
3. Create PHP files. Requesting the data and functions.
4. Creating JS files that will allow me to pop up a lightbox with more dynamic data.
5. Creating a Error handler in case the data never comes and could not be fetched.

## Conditions

1. Making a database.
2. Making a Read me file.
3. Making Error handler. In this case I made one for the console and one for the screen(Pop up Box).
4. Making a lightBox to show more dynamic data.
